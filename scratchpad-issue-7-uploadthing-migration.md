# Issue #7: Enhanced File Storage with UploadThing Integration

**GitHub Issue**: [#7 - Enhanced File Storage with UploadThing Integration](https://github.com/Santos-Enoque/aplycat/issues/7)

## Problem Analysis

The current implementation stores files as Base64 data URLs in PostgreSQL, causing:
- Database bloat with large binary data
- Performance issues with large file queries
- Memory overhead when loading files
- URL length limitations
- Poor scalability

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ What's Already Working
- UploadThing packages installed (`"uploadthing": "^7.5.0"`, `"@uploadthing/react": "^7.2.0"`)
- Basic UploadThing configuration in `lib/uploadthing.ts`
- Working UploadThing component in `components/file-upload-with-uploadthing.tsx`
- Hybrid storage system in `lib/resume-storage.ts` that supports both Base64 and UploadThing URLs
- Multiple upload components with different approaches
- Database schema already supports file URLs (`fileUrl` field in Resume model)

### ❌ What's Missing
- **Critical**: UploadThing API route (`app/api/uploadthing/core.ts` and `app/api/uploadthing/route.ts`)
- Complete UploadThing file router configuration
- Migration strategy for existing Base64 data
- Consolidation of multiple upload components
- File deletion functionality for UploadThing files

## Implementation Plan

## Detailed Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create UploadThing API Routes
**File**: `app/api/uploadthing/core.ts`
```typescript
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/next";
import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { db } from "@/lib/db";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const ourFileRouter = {
  resumeUploader: f({ 
    pdf: { maxFileSize: "10MB", maxFileCount: 1 },
    "application/msword": { maxFileSize: "10MB", maxFileCount: 1 },
    "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document": { maxFileSize: "10MB", maxFileCount: 1 }
  })
    .middleware(async ({ req }) => {
      const { userId } = auth();
      if (!userId) throw new Error("Unauthorized");
      return { userId };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // Save file metadata to database
      const resume = await db.resume.create({
        data: {
          userId: metadata.userId,
          fileName: file.name,
          fileUrl: file.url,
          uploadThingKey: file.key,
          fileSize: file.size,
          mimeType: file.type,
        },
      });
      return { uploadedBy: metadata.userId, resumeId: resume.id };
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter;
```

**File**: `app/api/uploadthing/route.ts`
```typescript
import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/next";
import { ourFileRouter } from "./core";

export const { GET, POST } = createRouteHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,
});
```

### Task 2: Update Database Schema
**Migration**: Add `uploadThingKey` field
```sql
ALTER TABLE "Resume" ADD COLUMN "uploadThingKey" TEXT;
```

### Task 3: Enhance Upload Component
**File**: `components/optimized-file-upload.tsx`
- Replace Base64 storage with UploadThing as primary method
- Keep Base64 for immediate analysis compatibility
- Add proper error handling and progress indicators

### Task 4: Add File Management Utilities
**File**: `lib/file-management.ts`
```typescript
export interface FileUploadResult {
  url: string;
  key: string;
  name: string;
  size: number;
}

export async function deleteResumeFile(key: string): Promise<void>
export async function getFileDownloadUrl(key: string): Promise<string>
```

### Task 5: Migration Script
**File**: `scripts/migrate-base64-to-uploadthing.ts`
