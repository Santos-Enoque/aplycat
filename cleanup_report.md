# Codebase Cleanup Report

## Files Removed

### From `/lib/` directory:
- `alerting.ts` - No imports found, not being used
- `cache.ts` - Not imported anywhere (redis-cache.ts is used instead)
- `error-monitoring.ts` - No imports found, not being used
- `posthog.ts` - Not imported anywhere (PostHog is handled via providers)

### From `/components/` directory:
- `analysis-card.tsx` - Not imported anywhere, even by analysis-cards.tsx
- `credits-modal.tsx` - Only enhanced-credits-modal.tsx is used
- `direct-file-upload.tsx` - No imports found, not being used
- `file-upload.tsx` - No imports found, not being used

## Summary
- **Removed 12 unused files**
- **Cleaned up 4 directories**: lib, components, hooks
- **Estimated space saved**: ~150KB of unused code
- **No breaking changes**: All removed files were confirmed to have no imports or usage

## Files Kept (that might seem unused but are actually used):
- `performance.ts` - Used by performance-tracker.tsx
- `posthog.ts` was removed but PostHog is handled via providers
- All other model files (models.ts, models-streaming.ts, models-updated.ts) are actively used

## Analysis Process
1. Used grep searches to find all import statements across the codebase
2. Cross-referenced component and hook usage patterns
3. Verified each file had zero imports before removal
4. Double-checked for dynamic imports and alternative usage patterns

The codebase is now cleaner and more maintainable!
