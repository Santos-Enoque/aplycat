# Optimized Project Structure

This document outlines the reorganized project structure implementing streaming analysis and best practices for Next.js applications.

## 🚀 New Architecture Overview

The optimized architecture follows the **Immediate Response Pattern**:

```
User Upload → Immediate Streaming Analysis → Background Database Operations
    ↓               ↓                              ↓
  < 1s          Real-time UI            Async (non-blocking)
```

ENABLE_STREAMING_ANALYSIS=true
ENABLE_BACKGROUND_OPERATIONS=true
```

### Feature Flags
```typescript
// lib/feature-flags.ts
export const FEATURE_FLAGS = {
  STREAMING_ANALYSIS: process.env.ENABLE_STREAMING_ANALYSIS === 'true',
  BACKGROUND_OPERATIONS: process.env.ENABLE_BACKGROUND_OPERATIONS === 'true',
  REAL_TIME_UPDATES: true,
} as const;
```

## 📈 Monitoring & Observability

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Performance Metrics**

   - Background operation completion time

2. **User Experience Metrics**
   - Bounce rate on analysis page
   - User engagement during streaming
   - Error recovery success rate

3. **System Metrics**
   - API response times
   - Database operation performance
   - Memory usage for streaming operations

### Logging Strategy
```typescript
// Structured logging for monitoring
console.log('[STREAMING_ANALYSIS]', {
  event: 'analysis_started',
  userId,
  fileName,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
});
```

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Streaming Security
- Input validation for file uploads
- Rate limiting for streaming endpoints
- Memory management for long-running streams

### Background Operations Security
