# Model Service Consolidation

## Overview

This document explains the consolidation of multiple model service files into a single source of truth: `lib/models-consolidated.ts`.

## Previous State

The codebase had three separate model files that caused confusion and inconsistency:

1. **`lib/models.ts`** - Basic model service with OpenAI and Gemini providers
2. **`lib/models-updated.ts`** - Enhanced model service with cached prompts and configuration
3. **`lib/models-streaming.ts`** - Streaming-capable model service with partial response parsing

Different API routes were importing from different files, leading to:

- Inconsistent behavior across endpoints
- Duplicate code and interfaces
- Difficulty maintaining and updating model logic
- Potential for bugs when features were available in one file but not others

## Current State

All model-related functionality has been consolidated into `lib/models-consolidated.ts`, which includes:

### Features Combined

- **Streaming Support**: Real-time response streaming with partial JSON parsing
- **Cached Prompts**: Integration with prompt cache for dynamic configuration
- **Multiple Providers**: Support for OpenAI and Gemini with unified interfaces
- **Structured Responses**: Zod schemas for type-safe resume analysis and improvement
- **Tool Support**: Function calling and web search capabilities
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Exported Services

- `modelService` - The main consolidated service instance
- `streamingModelService` - Alias for backward compatibility
- All necessary types and interfaces for API usage

### Methods Available

**Non-Streaming:**

- `analyzeResume()`
- `improveResume()`
- `tailorResume()`
- `extractJobInfo()`
- `generateResponse()`

**Streaming:**

- `analyzeResumeStream()`
- `improveResumeStream()`

## Migration Completed

All API routes have been updated to use the consolidated service:

- ✅ `app/api/tailor-resume/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/analyze-resume-stream/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/improve-resume/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/extract-job-info/route.ts`
- ✅ `app/api/improve-resume-stream/route.ts`
- ✅ `hooks/use-streaming-improvement.ts`

## Benefits

1. **Single Source of Truth**: All model logic in one place
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Same capabilities across all endpoints
3. **Easier Maintenance**: One file to update for model changes
4. **Better Type Safety**: Unified type definitions
5. **Improved Performance**: Optimized caching and provider management

## Next Steps

1. **Remove Old Files**: The following files can be safely deleted:

   - `lib/models.ts`
   - `lib/models-updated.ts`
   - `lib/models-streaming.ts`

2. **Testing**: Verify all API endpoints work correctly with the consolidated service

3. **Documentation**: Update any remaining documentation that references the old model files

## Breaking Changes

None - The consolidation maintains backward compatibility through:

- Exported aliases (`streamingModelService = modelService`)
- Same method signatures and return types
- Identical interface definitions
